        A 3D platformer game.
        <br><br>
        Made on Unity game engine. Runs on both x32 & x64 bit Windows PCs. Inspired by Marble Blast video game series.
        <br><br>
        Includes 1 level pack with 7 levels showcasing various game mechanics, such as moving platforms, ice, gems &
        portals.
        <br><br>
        Each level features a unique graphic theme with its own atmosphere - skybox, textures, effects & more.
        <br><br>
        Use <b>WASD or arrow keys</b> to move & <b>space key</b> to jump. Look around by holding <b>left mouse
        button & moving mouse</b>. Zoom in or out with <b>mouse scroll wheel</b>. <b>F1 key</b> to restart level. <b>Esc
        key</b> to quit.
        <br><br>
        <b>NB!</b> There is a known issue with the game - it's speed depends on FPS drastically & game can become very slow on
        very high frame rates. Therefore, game speed can be adjusted by selecting a different resolution or graphics quality
        setting. For reference, GTX 1050 Ti & fantastic graphics quality & Full HD resolution setup does produce a very
        comfortable gaming experience.
